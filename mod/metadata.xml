    Allows Isaac from the hit game Binding of Isaac to give trinkets to his friends and family, an activity which he loves.

This mod adds 3 sound triggers:
1) If a room reward is a trinket you'll exclaim "TRINKETS!"
2) Every time you drop a trinket while you have a friend or family nearby you'll express how much you love giving trinkets to your friends and family
3) When you use mom's box she'll tell you how much she loves giving trinkets to her friends and family (you)

You're welcome.
